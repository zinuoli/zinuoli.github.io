🎓 Excited to start my PhD journey in Computer Science at the **University of Western Australia (UWA)**!

I'll be working under the supervision of **Prof. Mohammed Bennamoun** and **Prof. Farid Boussaid**, with joint supervision from **Dr. Qiuhong Ke** at Monash University. My research will focus on **Video Understanding** and **Multimodal Large Language Models**.

Looking forward to contributing to the advancement of AI and multimodal understanding! 🚀
