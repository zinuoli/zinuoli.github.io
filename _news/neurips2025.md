🎉 Excited to announce that our paper **"Watch and Listen: Understanding Audio-Visual-Speech Moments with Multimodal LLM"** has been accepted to **NeurIPS 2025**!

This work introduces TriSense, a novel multimodal large language model that can understand audio-visual-speech moments in videos. Our approach combines visual, audio, and speech modalities to provide comprehensive video understanding capabilities.

Special thanks to all my collaborators: Xian Zhang, Yongxin Guo, Prof. Mohammed Bennamoun, Prof. Farid Boussaid, Girish Dwivedi, Luqi Gong, and Dr. Qiuhong Ke.
