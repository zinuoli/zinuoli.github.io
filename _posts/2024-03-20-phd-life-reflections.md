Starting a PhD is both exciting and daunting. As I reflect on my first few months at the University of Western Australia, I wanted to share some thoughts on this journey.

## The Transition

Moving from being a research assistant to a PhD student involves a significant shift in mindset. You're no longer just executing research tasks - you're expected to identify problems, propose solutions, and drive your own research agenda.

## Working with Multiple Supervisors

I'm fortunate to work with an amazing team of supervisors:
- **Prof. Mohammed Bennamoun** and **Prof. Farid Boussaid** at UWA provide the local support and institutional framework
- **Dr. Qiuhong Ke** at Monash University brings expertise in video understanding and multimodal learning

This collaborative arrangement has been incredibly valuable, offering diverse perspectives and expertise.

## Research Focus Evolution

My research interests have evolved from traditional computer vision problems (like document analysis and image enhancement) toward more complex multimodal understanding tasks. This evolution reflects both personal interests and the rapidly changing landscape of AI research.

## Challenges and Growth

Some key challenges I've encountered:
- **Scope management**: Learning to focus on specific, well-defined problems
- **Literature review**: Staying current with the rapidly evolving field
- **Technical depth**: Balancing breadth of knowledge with deep expertise
- **Time management**: Juggling research, coursework, and other responsibilities

## Looking Ahead

I'm excited about the opportunities ahead, particularly in multimodal AI and video understanding. The field is moving so quickly that there are always new problems to solve and new techniques to explore.

For anyone considering a PhD journey, my advice would be: embrace the uncertainty, stay curious, and don't be afraid to ask questions. The research community is generally very supportive and collaborative.
