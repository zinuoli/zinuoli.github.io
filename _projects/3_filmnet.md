FilmNet presents a comprehensive framework for film enhancement using a large-scale film style dataset. This project bridges the gap between traditional image processing and modern deep learning approaches for cinematic style transfer and enhancement.

## Dataset Contribution

### Film Style Dataset
- **Comprehensive Collection**: Thousands of film frames across different genres and eras
- **Style Diversity**: Covers various cinematic styles and aesthetic approaches
- **High Resolution**: Maintains quality suitable for professional applications
- **Metadata Rich**: Detailed annotations for style characteristics and technical parameters

## Technical Framework

### Multi-frequency Driven Enhancement

Our approach leverages multi-frequency analysis for superior film enhancement:

1. **Frequency Decomposition**: Separates content into different frequency bands
2. **Style-Specific Processing**: Applies different enhancement strategies per frequency band
3. **Adaptive Fusion**: Intelligently combines enhanced frequency components

### Key Innovations

- **Style-Aware Architecture**: Network design that understands cinematic aesthetics
- **Perceptual Loss Functions**: Optimized for visual quality and style consistency
- **Temporal Coherence**: Maintains consistency across video frames

## Applications

FilmNet enables various creative and professional applications:

- **Film Restoration**: Enhancing old or degraded film content
- **Style Transfer**: Applying cinematic styles to regular videos
- **Content Creation**: Assisting filmmakers in achieving desired visual aesthetics
- **Post-Production**: Automated enhancement in video editing workflows

## Results

The framework demonstrates superior performance in:
- Visual quality metrics
- Style consistency measures
- User preference studies
- Professional evaluation by filmmakers

## Impact

This work contributes to both academic research and practical applications in the film industry, providing tools for content creators and advancing the state-of-the-art in style transfer technology.
